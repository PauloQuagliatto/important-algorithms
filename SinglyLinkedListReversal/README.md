# Singly Linked List Reversal

The Singly Linked List Reversal algorithm is a technique used to reverse the order of elements in a singly linked list. A singly linked list is a data structure where each element (often called a "node") contains data and a reference (or a "link") to the next element in the sequence. However, each node does not have a reference to the previous node, which is what makes the list "singly" linked.

The reversal algorithm reorganizes the links between the nodes so that the element which was first becomes the last, the second becomes the second to last, and so on, effectively reversing the order of the nodes in the list. The algorithm typically involves iterating through the list and changing the next reference of each node to point to the previous node, a process that requires careful handling to avoid losing access to the nodes that have not yet been processed.

Here is a basic outline of how the Singly Linked List Reversal algorithm typically works:

1. **Initialize three pointers:** Previous (`prev`), Current (`curr`), and Next (`next`). Initially, `prev` is set to `null`, and `curr` is set to the head of the list.

2. **Iterate through the list:** For each node in the list, temporarily store the next node, change the current node's next link to point to the previous node, then update the previous and current pointers to move forward in the original list.

3. **Update the head of the list:** Once the end of the list is reached (i.e., `curr` is `null`), the head of the list is updated to the last node processed, which was previously the last node in the original list.

This algorithm is a fundamental operation in many applications and algorithms involving linked lists, as reversing a list can be useful in various contexts, such as algorithmic problem-solving, data processing, and more. It is particularly appreciated for its efficiency, requiring only a single pass through the list, and its in-place operation, needing no additional list to store the reversed sequence.
